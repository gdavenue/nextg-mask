It is a disposable mask made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly specialised process called melt blowing. During this process, the inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms the filtration layer capable of filtering out at <strong>least 95%</strong> of airborne particles when worn correctly."

          "text": "During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of intense air pollution, wearing <strong>N95 masks</strong> has been shown to help reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering out nasty pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate existing respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered respiration is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy and people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility can particularly benefit from wearing face masks while they are out in public and unable to control the breathing environments that they find themselves in."
